# Twatch
 An old FunCaptcha bypass for twitch with automated account creation and follow.
 It won't work as-it-is, they added more requests so you'll have to fix it. 
 Anyone with the knowledge to fix it could anyway have made everything in this repo, so wether I released it or not shouldn't have changed anything.
 
# Why releasing
 ArkoseLabs, if you're reading this: you are a trash company, and so is bugcrowd.
 You code like monkeys, without even making a rate limit (which is like the number 1 thing you should do for a captcha service).
 We show you, kindly, what are your mistakes and how to fix them. And you're too lazy to fix them...
 I reported this issue, got marked as duplicate for something that seemingly was reported years before me, which could mean two things:
  -Either they're too lazy to fix something actually important (which is very possible) (btw they marked this as P4 while their service becomes literally USELESS)
  -Or my issue has never been reported and they are blatantly lying about the fact that it has already been reported, so they don't have to give a reward.
 After my report being marked as duplicate, I respectfully asked for more informations - they never responded.
 
 Arkoselabs, Bugcrowd employees: I hope that you feel ashamed working for such awful companies.
