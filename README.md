# Twatch
 An old FunCaptcha solver for twitch with automated account creation and follow.
 It won't work as-it-is, they added more requests so you'll have to fix it. 
 Anyone with the knowledge to fix it could anyway have made everything in this repo, so wether I released it or not shouldn't have changed anything.
 
 This is a POC, so don't bother me with the state of the code - i know it is a mess.
